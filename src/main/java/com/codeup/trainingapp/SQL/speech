Good afternoon,

I’m Johnny Ruiz, This is Sam Moore, and Jason Lindsey  and together
we built the Texas Officer Training Portal
AKA T.O.P


using hibernate as an object-relational mapping solution
our web application allows
Texas Law Enforcement Officer’s to view and apply to courses,
Instructors to manage their courses and students,
And Training Coordinators to update and manage their curriculum and staff.

As a former Training Instructor I spent a considerable amount of time doing tedious tasks which
took from the time I could have utilized to improve the teachable content.

I also did not have functional way to inform officers of the upcoming courses I was teaching.

We created an effective solution with our application

Jason will now go further into the features available to a training coordinator
============================================================
Jason:
Let's log in as a training coordinator. our site uses spring security to authenticate users and then authorize them to use the site according to their roles. Here in the Coordinator's portal, a coordinator can view each of the members in their organization and change a student into an instructor. this is done asynchronously, using ajax requests which persist the data in our database without ever having to redirect or refresh the page. In the next tab, the coordinator can view each of the curricula provided by his or her organization and click the button on the right to see additional information such as learning objectives and course description . The coordinator can also fill out this form in the first dropdown to create a completely new curriculum for the organization to provide.  Now that We've created a curriculum, we can add a gradable assignment and associate it with the curriculum we've just created, or add one to an already existing curriculum.  finally the coordinator can view each of the courses along with their status and assign a new course to an instructor, who upon receiving it will fill in the rest of the course information and open it for enrollment. let's assign a course to sam who will now walk you through the features available to an instructor.

Sam:
My main contribution to the application was creating the instructors portal. As an Instructor we can check out the current courses that we are currently assigned to. Here we can see the new course that my user was just recently assigned to. Here in the overview tab we are able to edit the course details such as location, dates, times. Now let’s take a look at an older course. So here we can see a course that has been going on for a few weeks now. As you can see we have a roster that allows an instructor to contact a student either by email or phone. Our next tab as an instructor is the Attendance tab were we can see a list of dates each representing a specific day of class. We are able to make submissions to the currents days attendance simply by clicking the plus symbol and going through the roster selecting any students that might be absent today. As you can see we now have a tab with todays date that represents the attendance for today. The next tab is a grades tab will show us individual grades for each student for each grade. We can also submit grades. Next we can see students awaiting enrollment. We can confirm their request and now they are a student in this course, now let’s go through a students portal with johnny.

Johnny:

Thank you Sam

I will now log in as the existing user that Sam Approved to the “course name” course

As you can see after logging in as a student the user is directed to their Dashboard
Here they can immediately view the courses that they have applied to and the ones they am enrolled in.

note that the user is now enrolled in the course that Sam approved.

the user can also
View their  Grades, Attendance for each course

As you can see the user has not yet enrolled in any other courses.
A user can go to the courses page to view all courses
that are open for enrollment.

a user can view course information by clicking on the course name. the user can also click on the provider name which
redirects them to the providers page

This page displays the Provider's Contact information, A list of Instructors that teach under that provider,
and the courses from that provider that are open for enrollment.

A user can apply to a course from either the courses page or the provider page.
(apply to designated course)

As you can see the course is now pending approval and the appropriate instructor can approve or deny the request.

Another thing a user can view is the courses they have have received credit for completing.

Any user can update their profile information in the profile tab.
using form model binding a user can update any of the input fields
and click submit to update their information in our database.

Clicking on the about us link redirects the user to the page that displays our team’s contact information as well as
links to our linked in and GitHub accounts.

We look forward to meeting with you all and answering any questions you may have.
